The two bugs that were found were: a Conditional Jump or move depends on uninitialized
value(s)(dominion.c:661) as well as uninitialized values(dominion.c:850). I found these bugs through the
use of Valgrind. valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file="logfile.out" -v <test file> produced log files of the
valgrind instrumented process. One of the bugs was not that interesting (an uninitialized value) but the
other (conditional jump depending on uninitialized value) was interesting. It was interesting because this
reflects a core logical flaw in the game code.
